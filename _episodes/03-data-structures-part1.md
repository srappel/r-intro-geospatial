One of R's most powerful features is its ability to deal with tabular data -
such as you may already have in a spreadsheet or a CSV file. Let's start by
downloading and reading in a file `nordic-data.csv`. We will
save this data as an object named `nordic`:


~~~
nordic <- read.csv("data/nordic-data.csv")
~~~
{: .language-r}

The `read.table` function is used for reading in tabular data stored in a text
file where the columns of data are separated by punctuation characters such as
CSV files (csv = comma-separated values). Tabs and commas are the most common
punctuation characters used to separate or delimit data points in csv files.
For convenience R provides 2 other versions of `read.table`. These are: `read.csv`
for files where the data are separated with commas and `read.delim` for files
where the data are separated with tabs. Of these three functions `read.csv` is
the most commonly used.  If needed it is possible to override the default
delimiting punctuation marks for both `read.csv` and `read.delim`.

We can begin exploring our dataset right away, pulling out columns by specifying
them using the `$` operator:


~~~
nordic$country
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "Denmark" "Sweden"  "Norway" 
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
nordic$lifeExp
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 77.2 80.0 79.0
~~~
{: .output}

We can do other operations on the columns. For example, if we discovered that the life expectancy is two years higher: 


~~~
nordic$lifeExp + 2
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 79.2 82.0 81.0
~~~
{: .output}

But what about:


~~~
nordic$lifeExp + nordic$country
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in nordic$lifeExp + nordic$country: non-numeric argument to binary operator
~~~
{: .error}

Understanding what happened here is key to successfully analyzing data in R.

## Data Types

If you guessed that the last command will return an error because `77.2` plus
`"Denmark"` is nonsense, you're right - and you already have some intuition for an
important concept in programming called *data classes*. We can ask what class of
data something is:


~~~
class(nordic$lifeExp)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "numeric"
~~~
{: .output}

There are 6 main types: `numeric`, `integer`, `complex`, `logical`, `character`, and `factor`.


~~~
class(3.14)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "numeric"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
class(1L) # The L suffix forces the number to be an integer, since by default R uses float numbers
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "integer"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
class(1+1i)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "complex"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
class(TRUE)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "logical"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
class('banana')
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "character"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
class(factor('banana'))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "factor"
~~~
{: .output}

No matter how
complicated our analyses become, all data in R is interpreted a specific 
data class. This strictness has some really important consequences.

A user has added new details of age expectancy. This information is in the file
`data/nordic-data-2.csv`.

Load the new nordic data as `nordic_2`, and check what class of data we find in the
`lifeExp` column:


~~~
nordic_2 <- read.csv("data/nordic-data-2.csv")
class(nordic_2$lifeExp)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "character"
~~~
{: .output}

Oh no, our life expectancy lifeExp aren't the numeric type anymore! If we try to do the same math
we did on them before, we run into trouble:


~~~
nordic_2$lifeExp + 2
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in nordic_2$lifeExp + 2: non-numeric argument to binary operator
~~~
{: .error}

What happened? When R reads a csv file into one of these tables, it insists that
everything in a column be the same class; if it can't understand
*everything* in the column as numeric, then *nothing* in the column gets to be numeric. The table that R loaded our nordic data into is something called a
dataframe, and it is our first example of something called a *data
structure* - that is, a structure which R knows how to build out of the basic
data types.

We can see that it is a dataframe by calling the `class()` function on it:


~~~
class(nordic)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "data.frame"
~~~
{: .output}

In order to successfully use our data in R, we need to understand what the basic
data structures are, and how they behave. 

## Vectors and Type Coercion

To better understand this behavior, let's meet another of the data structures:
the vector.


~~~
my_vector <- vector(length = 3)
my_vector
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE
~~~
{: .output}

A vector in R is essentially an ordered list of things, with the special
condition that everything in the vector must be the same basic data type. If
you don't choose the data type, it'll default to `logical`; or, you can declare
an empty vector of whatever type you like.


~~~
another_vector <- vector(mode = 'character', length = 3)
another_vector
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "" "" ""
~~~
{: .output}

You can check if something is a vector:


~~~
str(another_vector)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 chr [1:3] "" "" ""
~~~
{: .output}

The somewhat cryptic output from this command indicates the basic data type
found in this vector - in this case `chr`, character; an indication of the
number of things in the vector - actually, the indexes of the vector, in this
case `[1:3]`; and a few examples of what's actually in the vector - in this case
empty character strings. If we similarly do


~~~
str(nordic$lifeExp)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 num [1:3] 77.2 80 79
~~~
{: .output}

we see that `nordic$lifeExp` is a vector, too - the columns of data we load into R
data frames are all vectors, and that's the root of why R forces everything in
a column to be the same basic data type.

{: .discussion}

You can also make vectors with explicit contents with the combine function:


~~~
combine_vector <- c(2, 6, 3)
combine_vector
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 2 6 3
~~~
{: .output}

Given what we've learned so far, what do you think the following will produce?


~~~
quiz_vector <- c(2, 6, '3')
~~~
{: .language-r}

This is something called *type coercion*, and it is the source of many surprises
and the reason why we need to be aware of the basic data types and how R will
interpret them. When R encounters a mix of types (here numeric and character) to
be combined into a single vector, it will force them all to be the same
type. Consider:


~~~
coercion_vector <- c('a', TRUE)
coercion_vector
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "a"    "TRUE"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
another_coercion_vector <- c(0, TRUE)
another_coercion_vector
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 0 1
~~~
{: .output}

The coercion rules go: `logical` -> `integer` -> `numeric` -> `complex` ->
`character`, where -> can be read as *are transformed into*. You can try to
force coercion against this flow using the `as.` functions:


~~~
character_vector_example <- c('0', '2', '4')
character_vector_example
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "0" "2" "4"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
character_coerced_to_numeric <- as.numeric(character_vector_example)
character_coerced_to_numeric
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 0 2 4
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
numeric_coerced_to_logical <- as.logical(character_coerced_to_numeric)
numeric_coerced_to_logical
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
~~~
{: .output}

As you can see, some surprising things can happen when R forces one basic data
type into another! Nitty-gritty of type coercion aside, the point is: if your
data doesn't look like what you thought it was going to look like, type coercion
may well be to blame; make sure everything is the same type in your vectors and
your columns of data frames, or you will get nasty surprises!

The combine function, `c()`, will also append things to an existing vector:


~~~
ab_vector <- c('a', 'b')
ab_vector
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "a" "b"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
combine_example <- c(ab_vector, 'DC')
combine_example
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "a"  "b"  "DC"
~~~
{: .output}

You can also make series of numbers:


~~~
my_series <- 1:10
my_series
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
seq(10)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
seq(1,10, by = 0.1)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 [1]  1.0  1.1  1.2  1.3  1.4  1.5  1.6  1.7  1.8  1.9  2.0  2.1  2.2  2.3  2.4
[16]  2.5  2.6  2.7  2.8  2.9  3.0  3.1  3.2  3.3  3.4  3.5  3.6  3.7  3.8  3.9
[31]  4.0  4.1  4.2  4.3  4.4  4.5  4.6  4.7  4.8  4.9  5.0  5.1  5.2  5.3  5.4
[46]  5.5  5.6  5.7  5.8  5.9  6.0  6.1  6.2  6.3  6.4  6.5  6.6  6.7  6.8  6.9
[61]  7.0  7.1  7.2  7.3  7.4  7.5  7.6  7.7  7.8  7.9  8.0  8.1  8.2  8.3  8.4
[76]  8.5  8.6  8.7  8.8  8.9  9.0  9.1  9.2  9.3  9.4  9.5  9.6  9.7  9.8  9.9
[91] 10.0
~~~
{: .output}

We can ask a few questions about vectors:


~~~
sequence_example <- seq(10)
head(sequence_example,n = 2)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 1 2
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
tail(sequence_example, n = 4)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1]  7  8  9 10
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
length(sequence_example)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 10
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
class(sequence_example)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "integer"
~~~
{: .output}

Finally, you can give names to elements in your vector:


~~~
my_example <- 5:8
names(my_example) <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
my_example
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
a b c d 
5 6 7 8 
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
names(my_example)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "a" "b" "c" "d"
~~~
{: .output}

{: .challenge}


## Factors

We said that columns in data frames were vectors:


~~~
str(nordic$lifeExp)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 num [1:3] 77.2 80 79
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
str(nordic$year)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 int [1:3] 2002 2002 2002
~~~
{: .output}

These make sense. But what about


~~~
str(nordic$country)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 chr [1:3] "Denmark" "Sweden" "Norway"
~~~
{: .output}

Another important data structure is called a factor. Factors look like character
data, but are used to represent categorical information. For example, let's make
a vector of strings labeling nordic countries for all the countries in our
study:


~~~
nordic_countries <- c('Norway', 'Finland', 'Denmark', 'Iceland', 'Sweden')
nordic_countries
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "Norway"  "Finland" "Denmark" "Iceland" "Sweden" 
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
str(nordic_countries)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 chr [1:5] "Norway" "Finland" "Denmark" "Iceland" "Sweden"
~~~
{: .output}

We can turn a vector into a factor like so:


~~~
categories <- factor(nordic_countries)
class(categories)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "factor"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
str(categories)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 Factor w/ 5 levels "Denmark","Finland",..: 4 2 1 3 5
~~~
{: .output}

Now R has noticed that there are 5 possible categories in our data - but it
also did something surprising; instead of printing out the strings we gave it,
we got a bunch of numbers instead. R has replaced our human-readable categories
with numbered indices under the hood, this is necessary as many statistical
calculations utilise such numerical representations for categorical data:


~~~
class(nordic_countries)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "character"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
class(categories)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "factor"
~~~
{: .output}

{: .challenge}

When doing statistical modelling, it's important to know what the baseline
levels are. This is assumed to be the first factor, but by default factors are
labeled in alphabetical order. You can change this by specifying the levels:


~~~
mydata <- c("case", "control", "control", "case")
factor_ordering_example <- factor(mydata, levels = c("control", "case"))
str(factor_ordering_example)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 Factor w/ 2 levels "control","case": 2 1 1 2
~~~
{: .output}

In this case, we've explicitly told R that "control" should represented by 1,
and "case" by 2. This designation can be very important for interpreting the
results of statistical models!

## Lists

Another data structure you'll want in your bag of tricks is the `list`. A list
is simpler in some ways than the other types, because you can put anything you
want in it:


~~~
list_example <- list(1, "a", TRUE, c(2, 6, 7))
list_example
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[[1]]
[1] 1

[[2]]
[1] "a"

[[3]]
[1] TRUE

[[4]]
[1] 2 6 7
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
another_list <- list(title = "Numbers", numbers = 1:10, data = TRUE )
another_list
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
$title
[1] "Numbers"

$numbers
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

$data
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}

We can now understand something a bit surprising in our data frame; what happens if we compare `str(nordic)` and `str(another_list)`:


~~~
str(nordic)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
'data.frame':	3 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ country: chr  "Denmark" "Sweden" "Norway"
 $ year   : int  2002 2002 2002
 $ lifeExp: num  77.2 80 79
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
str(another_list)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
List of 3
 $ title  : chr "Numbers"
 $ numbers: int [1:10] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
 $ data   : logi TRUE
~~~
{: .output}

We see that the output for these two objects look very similar. It is because
data frames are lists 'under the hood'. Data frames are a special case of lists where each element (the columns of the data frame) have the same lengths.

In our `nordic` example, we have an integer, a double and a logical variable. As
we have seen already, each column of data frame is a vector.


~~~
nordic$country
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "Denmark" "Sweden"  "Norway" 
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
nordic[, 1]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "Denmark" "Sweden"  "Norway" 
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
class(nordic[, 1])
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "character"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
str(nordic[, 1])
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 chr [1:3] "Denmark" "Sweden" "Norway"
~~~
{: .output}

Each row is an *observation* of different variables, itself a data frame, and
thus can be composed of elements of different types.


~~~
nordic[1, ]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  country year lifeExp
1 Denmark 2002    77.2
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
class(nordic[1, ])
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "data.frame"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
str(nordic[1, ])
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
'data.frame':	1 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ country: chr "Denmark"
 $ year   : int 2002
 $ lifeExp: num 77.2
~~~
